# GMDL-Assignment1
This repository contains Python code that implements the Ising model for image reconstruction. The code generates a random matrix, simulates random Gaussian noise, and uses the Ising model, Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM), and an argmax-based method to reconstruct images from the noisy input. 
### Introduction
The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes the behavior of spins in a system. In this code, the Ising model is applied to reconstruct images from noisy input, and two additional methods (ICM and argmax) are provided for comparison.
### Dependencies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
### Examples
[The code](https://github.com/ofekoOren/GMDL-Assignment1/blob/main/GMDL01.ipynb) includes examples showcasing image reconstruction using different temperatures for the Ising model. Each example generates original images, introduces random noise, and applies various reconstruction methods.
